# university-game-engine
A C++/OpenGL game engine I created at Bournemouth University (2018). The scene uses a vaguely entity-component architecture for the scene, renders using OpenGL, and even has some basic AABB physics and collision.

Demonstrates a number of graphical features:
- Deferred rendering
- Multiple point lights
- Shadow mapping
- Several LOD techniques
- Phong Tessellation
- Displacement mapping
